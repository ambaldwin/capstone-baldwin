Leftover Love

Food waste is a huge issue. More than $140 billion dollars in food is thrown away each year. There are huge economic and enviornmental impacts that goes along with this. Unfortunately, it's easier and cheaper than any other option for restaurants to throw away their extra food.

What is this thing?
Leftover Love allows restaurants to sell this extra food at a discount to customers who are looking for cheap, but high quality meals. So, restaurants post available meals, and then hungry users purchase this food and a text message alert lets them now when it's ready.
